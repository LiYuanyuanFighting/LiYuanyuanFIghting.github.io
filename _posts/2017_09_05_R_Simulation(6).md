**Discrete probability distributions**  
**Binomial Distribution**  
The Binomial distribution B(n, p) we can derive as follows, that is the probability that   
the event A occurs exactly x times in n replicates is derived as follows:  
The event A occurs only with the first x experiments: A, A,..., A,(x times), B, B, B, ..., A  
(n-x) times.  
The probability of this sequence of independent experiments is p^x(1-p)^(n-x).  
Considering all possible arrangemenmts (n x)(Note: this should be vertical) the following applies:  
P(hn(A)=x) = (n x)p^x(1-p)^(n-x), where (n x)=n!/( (n-x)!x! ) is the Binomial coefficient.

**Continuous Probability Distributions**  
One calls the function a -> F(a)=P(x<=a) the distribution function of the probability distribution  
of x. F(a) is the probability to observe X<=a. Also, for f(x) it holds:  
0<=F(x) <=1, F(x) is a monotone increasing: given x1<=x2 it follows that F(x1) <= F(x2).  
The derivative of the distribution function f(x)=F'(x) is called the density of the distribution  
of x. It holds that f(x)>=0 and the integral of f(x) from minus infinity to plus infinity equals to 1.  

Normal distribution is a representative of a continuous probability distribution.
