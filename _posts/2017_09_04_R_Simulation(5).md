### Monte Carlo Methods for Optimization Problems

Steepest descent would just be in the opposite direction to the steepest ascent.

The length of the gradient measures the maximum possible rate of change rate. So in  
the opposite direction you just get the opposite value negative root 6, we can't go  
down any faster than that and so we won't be able to do it.
