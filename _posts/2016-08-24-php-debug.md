# Enable Xdebug in eclipse pdt

####The process is as following:
1.modify php.ini,add sentences as following:
[XDebug]
zend_extension = "H:\oracle\XAAMP\php\ext\php_xdebug-2.4.0-7.0-vc14.dll"
xdebug.remote_enable = 1
xdebug.remote_handler = "dbgp"
xdebug.remote_host = "localhost"
xdebug.trace_output_dir = "C:\xampp\tmp"
;xdebug.output_buffering = off
2.Configure your server by following the instructions on 'adding a new server  
(http://www.eclipse.org/pdt/help/html/php_servers.htm#Adding_servers)'
under the PHP Servers Preferences page.
3.select debug option in eclipse:debug configurations->select Xdebug
4.when debug, add breakpoints in php sentence,and in debug view: variables: have  
the corresponding values which should be helpful in debugging

The process is only a general process which is not in detail.

errors occured:
设置php server，选择Local Apache Http Server，定位到wamp/bin/apache然后输入name为apache，  
提示“Installation Directory does not contain Apache HTTP Server configuration.”

       解决方案：定位到wamp/bin/apache下的conf 目录，即：wamp/bin/apache/conf
