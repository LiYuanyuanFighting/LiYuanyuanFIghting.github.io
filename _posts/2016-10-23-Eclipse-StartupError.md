## Eclipse - no Java (JRE) / (JDK) â€¦ no virtual machine

Because I installed 3 different eclipse versions which contains both 32 bit and 64 bit,
so i often have problems of starting up eclipse correctly, like the error messages in
the title.

Solution: as referred in the error message, I simply put jre directory in the corresponding path,
but remember the versions of both eclipse and jre should identical.
