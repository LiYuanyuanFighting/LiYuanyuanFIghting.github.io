1. to check errors happended to R in java, could use try in Rengine:  
engine.eval("traindataFull= try(read.csv(file=f, header='T', stringsAsFactors='F'))");  
2. Rserve is a server and the Rserve JAR files provide the client implementations to interact with Rserve, just like there are JavaScript clients on npm.

Thus to call R scripts through Rserve, Rserve server needs to be already started and waiting to receive calls. This can be done from R using:

library(Rserve)
Rserve()
or,: R CMD Rserve --vanilla directly from linux bash or,calling it directly from Java using JavaRuntime API to access the runtime:

Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec("R CMD RServe --vanilla");
although this also works for linux only.

Then you should execute your Java client code to connect to the Rserve server and eval() all your R commands through Rserve.
