**1. enum type in java**
1) Enums in Java are type-safe and has their own namespace. It means your enum will have a type for example "Currency" in below example and you can not assign any value other than specified in Enum Constants.
  
public enum Currency {
PENNY, NICKLE, DIME, QUARTER
};
Currency coin = Currency.PENNY;
coin = 1; //compilation error

**3. TODO**
the summation of ENUM in java   

name() is literally the textual name in the java code of the enum. That means it is limited to strings that can actually appear in your java code, but not all desirable strings are expressible in code. For example, you may need a string that begins with a number. name() will never be able to obtain that string for you.
A practical example when name() and toString() make sense to be different is a pattern where single-valued enum is used to define a singleton. It looks surprisingly at first but makes a lot of sense:

enum SingletonComponent {
    INSTANCE(/*..configuration...*/);

    /* ...behavior... */

    @Override
    String toString() {
      return "SingletonComponent"; // better than default "INSTANCE"
    }
}
In such case:

SingletonComponent myComponent = SingletonComponent.INSTANCE;
assertThat(myComponent.name()).isEqualTo("INSTANCE"); // blah
assertThat(myComponent.toString()).isEqualTo("SingletonComponent"); // better
