# What is the use of seed in R  

The need s the possible desire for reproducible results, which may for example come from trying to debug your program, or of course from trying to redo what it does:

These two results we will "never" reproduce as I just asked for something "random":

R> sample(LETTERS, 5)
[1] "K" "N" "R" "Z" "G"
R> sample(LETTERS, 5)
[1] "L" "P" "J" "E" "D"
These two, however, are identical because I set the seed:

R> set.seed(42); sample(LETTERS, 5)
[1] "X" "Z" "G" "T" "O"
R> set.seed(42); sample(LETTERS, 5)
[1] "X" "Z" "G" "T" "O"
R>
