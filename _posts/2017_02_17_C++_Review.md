**C++ design patterns**   
C++: not an ideal OOP language: Too low level.
Headache to:
i) manage resources (eg memory)
ii) implement design patterns (use workarounds)
Use C++ because:
i) Widely used.
ii) C++ idioms do exist: Can do design patterns.
Here mainly concerned with numerical methods.
Still have to worry about memory allocation.
Still have to use proper idioms.
But, C++ is fast and efficient for numerical problems   

**Namespace std**
Everything in the C++ standard libraries is in namespace std.
#include a library? You must also scope. Either
i) have using namespace std; at start of file,
ii) have using std::vector; at start of file,
or iii) explicitly scope, eg std::vector.
Usually much better to scope explicitly.
If want to use cout function in <iostream> then #include <iostream>
and use std::cout << x;
(If have using namespace std;
or using std::cout;
at start of file can use cout << x;)  

**Destructors**   
"Destructor" functions are the inverse of constructor functions. They are called when objects are destroyed (deallocated). Designate a function as a class's destructor by preceding the class name with a tilde (~). For example, the destructor for class String is declared: ~String().  
The destructor is commonly used to "clean up" when an object is no longer necessary.  
e.g.  
    // spec1_destructors.cpp  
    #include <string.h>  
      
    class String {  
    public:  
       String( char *ch );  // Declare constructor  
       ~String();           //  and destructor.  
    private:  
       char    *_text;  
       size_t  sizeOfText;  
    };  
      
    // Define the constructor.  
    String::String( char *ch ) {  
       sizeOfText = strlen( ch ) + 1;  
      
       // Dynamically allocate the correct amount of memory.  
       _text = new char[ sizeOfText ];  
      
       // If the allocation succeeds, copy the initialization string.  
       if( _text )  
          strcpy_s( _text, sizeOfText, ch );  
    }  
      
    // Define the destructor.  
    String::~String() {  
       // Deallocate the memory that was previously reserved  
       //  for this string.  
       if (_text)  
          delete[] _text;  
    }  

Where possible:
Always use string not char *.
Always use vector not eg double *.
