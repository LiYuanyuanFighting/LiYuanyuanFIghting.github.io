**C++ design patterns**
C++: not an ideal OOP language: Too low level.
Headache to:
i) manage resources (eg memory)
ii) implement design patterns (use workarounds)
Use C++ because:
i) Widely used.
ii) C++ idioms do exist: Can do design patterns.
Here mainly concerned with numerical methods.
Still have to worry about memory allocation.
Still have to use proper idioms.
But, C++ is fast and efficient for numerical problems
