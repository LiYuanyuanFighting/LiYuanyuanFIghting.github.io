In the assignment, it introduces an algorithm----A*, after checking it, I just realized
how widely use it is.
**A*(A star)** is a computer algorithm widely used in pathfinding and graph traversal.   
The simplest (and least efficient) method of traversing a graph is the **Depth First Search**   
(an algorithm starts at the root and explores as far as possible along each branch before    
backtracking. In some area, the graph to be traversed is often either too large to visit  
in its entirety or infinite, then DFS will suffer non-termination).  

Pathfinders enable us to plan ahead rather than waiting until the last moment to discover   
there is a problem.

**backtrack**   
In backtracking algorithms, try to build one step at a time. If at some step it become clear
that the current path that you are on cannot lead to a solution you go back to. Common example   
is Eight qqueens puzzle:
    queens = [0,0...,0]
    for i=1 to maxRows:
        for j=1 to maxRows:
            queens[i] = queens[i]++
            if queensNotUnderAttack(i) then:
                break
            else :
                if j == maxRows then: i--

Dijikstra's algorithm works well to find the shorted path, but it wastes time in exploring directions  
that aren't promising. Greedy Best First Search algorithm selects the vertex closest to the goal, exploring  
in promising directions but it may not find the shortest path. The A* algorithm uses both the actual    
distance from the start and the estimated distance to the goal.  

Compare the algorithms: Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm calculates the distance from the start point. Greedy   
Best-First Search estimates the distance to the goal point. A* is using the sum of those two distances.

#### Notes  
(1)To calculate Manhattan priority is to calculate the sum of the distance in vertical and horizontal.
(2)Unsolvable case: if the initial board can become into global board by swapping any pair of blocks.(prove!)
