### Python Basics with numpy
**Goal**  
 - Learn how to use numpy.

- Implement some basic core deep learning functions such as the softmax, sigmoid, dsigmoid, etc...

- Learn how to handle data by normalizing inputs and reshaping images.

- Recognize the importance of vectorization.

- Understand how python broadcasting works.   
Reminder: sigmoid(x)=1/(1+e−x) sigmoid(x)=11+e−x is sometimes also known as the logistic function.   
It is a non-linear function used not only in Machine Learning (Logistic Regression), but also   
in Deep Learning. In math, use math.exp()  
we use "numpy" instead of "math" in Deep Learning
