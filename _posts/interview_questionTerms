**Low Level Language**
Low-level languages can convert to machine code without a compiler or interpreter— second-generation   
programming languages use a simpler processor called an assembler— and the resulting code runs directly on the processor.

It deals with a computer's hardware components and constraints.  
 Generally this refers to either machine code or assembly language. The word "low" refers to the small or nonexistent  
 amount of abstraction between the language and machine language;

**What is the difference between DROP and REJECT rules on a firewall? **   
When a packet reaches the firewall, it is run against a set of rules. These rules may rely on existing state (eg. to match existing or related connections) or be stateless (eg. to match destination port 80). The rules determine an action to take for the packet, which can be one of:

ALLOW (aka ACCEPT)
Pemit a packet to traverse the firewall. This would be the behaviour if the firewall was not present.
REJECT
Prohibit a packet from passing. Send an ICMP destination-unreachable back to the source host [unless the icmp would not normally be permitted, eg. if it is to/from the broadcast address].
DROP (aka DENY, BLACKHOLE)
Prohibit a packet from passing. Send no response.
**Legitimate users**
By REJECTing unknown packets, TCP aborts the connection andthe application gets to know that the connection has failed after just one round-trip time. This allows the application attempting the connection to notify the user straight away.

DROPping the packet will just cause TCP to retry the connection until the threshold for retranmission is exceeded. This should be at least 100 seconds.
Hostile users

**hostile forces:**

A common reason for using DROP rather than REJECT is to avoid giving away information about which ports are open, however, discarding packets gives away exactly as much information as the rejection.

With REJECT, you do your scan and categorise the results into "connection established" and "connection rejected".

With DROP, you categorise the results into "connection established" and "connection timed out"

**linux command**

tail -f	如果输入文件是常规文件或如果 File 参数指定 FIFO（先进先出），那么 tail 命令不会在复制了输入文件的最后的指定单元后终止，而是继续从输入文件读取  
和复制额外的单元（当这些单元可用时）。如果没有指定 File 参数，并且标准输入是管道，那么会忽略 -f 标志。tail -f 命令可用于监视另一个进程正在写入的文件  
的增长。

View the content of the file in real time using tail -f. This is useful to view the log files, that keeps growing. The command can be   
terminated using CTRL-C.

**evasion technique**
https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/security-data-protection/the-four-most-common-evasive-techniques-used-by-malware/
four types in particular are most common: 
1) environmental awareness, 
allows malware samples to detect the underlying runtime environment of the system it is trying to infect.
2) confusing automated tools, 
confusing automated tools, allows malware to avoid detection by technologies such as signature-based antivirus software. 
3) timing-based evasion, and 
This type of behavior is used by malware to run at certain times or following certain actions taken by the user
4) obfuscating internal data.
obfuscating internal data. Malware that implement this tactic might use any number of tricks to run code that cannot be detected by the analysis system.

**he Difference Between a Computer Virus, Worm and Trojan Horse**
A computer virus attaches itself to a program or file enabling it to spread from one computer  
to another, leaving infections as it travels. 
It is important to note that a virus cannot be spread without a human action, 
A worm is similar to a virus by design and is considered to be a sub-class of a virus. Worms   
spread from computer to computer, but unlike a virus, it has the capability to travel without  
any human action.  
A worm takes advantage of file or information transport features on your system, which is what  
allows it to travel unaided.  
 A Trojan Horse is full of as much trickery as the mythological Trojan Horse it was named after.  
 The Trojan Horse, at first glance will appear to be useful software but will actually do damage  
 once installed or run on your computer.  Those on the receiving end of a Trojan Horse   
 Trojans are also known to create a backdoor on your computer that gives malicious users access  
 to your system, possibly allowing confidential or personal  
 information to be compromised. Unlike viruses and worms, Trojans do not reproduce by infecting  
 other files nor do they self-replicate.
 
 **IOC**
 Indicators of Compromise (IOC) are pieces of forensic data, such as data found in system log entries or files, that identify potentially malicious  
 activity on a system or network.
 http://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/top-15-indicators-of-compromise/d/d-id/1140647?
 According to the experts, here are some key indicators of compromise to monitor (in no particular order):

1. Unusual Outbound Network Traffic
3. Geographical Irregularities
6. HTML Response Sizes
if attackers use SQL injection to extract data through a Web application, the requests issued by them will    
usually have a larger HTML response size than a normal request.
7. Large Numbers Of Requests For The Same File
2. Anomalies In Privileged User Account Activity

 
 are usually tricked into opening them because they appear to be receiving legitimate software or files from a legitimate source. 


**SQL Injection**
input code like 105 or 1=1 or "", in select condition:select * from user_table where username=105 or 1=1, it will be always true,
which means it will select all users. So need to avoid:
Method1: limit the input like I only allow numbers in price box
Method2: use prepared statement, any parameters you send when using a prepared statement will
just be treated as strings.
Method3: do some processing, to escape special characters:mysql_real_escape_string

**Botnet**
Zombie army. is a number of Internet computers that, although their owners are unaware of it,  
have been set up to forward transmissions (including spam or viruses) to other computers on  
the Internet. Any such computer is referred to as a zombie - in effect, a computer "robot" or  
"bot" that serves the wishes of some master spam or virus originator.

**Denial of service attack***
To make  a machine or network resource unavailable, it is accomplished by flooding the targeted
machine or resource with superfluous requests in an attempt to overload systems and prevent some
or all legitimate requests from being fufilled

**How would you check if a file is a known malware, without sharing the actual binary?**
**Is it enough to rely on a "simple hash"? (Related to question 9). What else could you do   
to be more reliable? **

**Have you heard or read details about any vulnerabilities of these recent years/months?  **

The latest forum to leak, Disney's Playdom, was running the vBulletin forumware already known to have leaked big back in June.

On Friday, Disney announced it had taken the forum offline after discovering someone had  
accessed usernames, passwords, e-mail addresses,  and logged IP addresses for playdomforums.  
com accounts. Its oops-we're-so--sorry-statement includes the usual useless assurance that  
no credit card data was held on the site.
These recent forum hacks demonstrate how popular online platforms remain vulnerable to   
fundamental exploits. Unfortunately, even though the look and feel of most internet   
platforms has generally changed, managing forum software continue to be a difficult  
challenge as these platforms are exposed to the public—meaning most databases remain  
vulnerable to specific types of attacks.
Upgrading forum software is generally a non-trivial task and the updates take some   
time to be released, which is probably why most admins do not update right away.  
In the Clash of Kings hack incident, and possibly others, the hacker took advantage of  
an unpatched bug—reportedly because the CoK forum was using a vBulletin version that  
dates back to 2013, and that it didn't use any encryption. In the case of the incidents  
that affected Ubuntu and Warframe, attackers were able to exploit an SQL injection   
vulnerability, making it an apparent favorite tool among hackers. However, minor oversights,   
such as relying on older or outdated software, or not implementing the latest patch, magnify  
the risks.

**Have you ever use any vulnerability scanners? Which ones? What was the context?**
OPENVAS, an open-source product, it is composed by a server to which several clients can 
connect to require to perform vulnerability analysis. The main components: a scanner and a manage.
eg. starts Apache, and uses openvas to discover the vulnerabilities:
Apache provides information about the service(e.g.version, generic OS-type of the server as well
as information about compiled-in modules. a.s.o)

At the time of writing, the site remained offline. Disney hasn't stated how many accounts were leaked in the attack, nor has it explained why passwords were held in an accessible format.
