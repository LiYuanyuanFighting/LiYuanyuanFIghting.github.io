**Goal?**   
Have you ever wondered how map overlays for Google Maps are created? In the project 
for this course you will build your own interactive visualization of a large dataset 
tagged by geospatial information.

Learning outcomes:

Build an interactive graphical program in Java
Design classes to make use of object-oriented programming paradigms
Explain inheritance and polymorphism and how each concept is applied in the creation of a Java GUI
Explain how event handling works in Java, and write event handlers to create an interactive program
Write and apply searching and sorting algorithms to manage large data sets
Find and fix errors (bugs) in code
Develop and use test cases to ensure correctness of a program

2 libraries used:  
[Unfolding is a library to create interactive maps and geovisualizations in Processing and Java](http://unfoldingmaps.org/ "Unfolding is a library to create interactive maps and geovisualizations in Processing and Java")
[SQLite JDBC Driver](https://bitbucket.org/xerial/sqlite-jdbc/ "SQLite JDBC Driver")### 主要特性
