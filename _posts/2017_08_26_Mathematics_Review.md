**Variables**  
independent variable: 自变量  
dependent variable: 因变量  
assume y=x, then y is dependent variable, x is independent variable.  
**What is regression analysis**  
Regression Analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships among variables.   
The focus is on a dependent variable(goal) and one or more independent variables(predictors), regression   
analysis helps one understand how the typical value of the dependent variable (or 'criterion variable')   
changes when any one of the independent variables is varied, while the other independent variables are   
held fixed.  
**Regression Technique**  
There are mainly 3 measurements in these techiques: 1.No. of independent variables, 2.Shape of the regression  
line, 3.Type of dependent variable.  
1.Linear Regression  
In linear regression, the model specification is that the dependent variable, yi is a linear combination of   
the parameters (but need not be linear in the independent variables).   
Use a function to stand for it:  
Y=a+b*X+e.  
**Logistic Regression**  
In statistics, logistic regression, or logit regression, or logit model[1] is a regression model where the  
dependent variable (DV) is categorical.  
It is used to calculate the probabilities of "Event = Success" and "Event = Failure". When the type of dependent  
variable belongs to binary(1/0, True/False, Yes/No) variables, we should use logistic regression.  
**Polynomial Regression**  
if the exponent of an independent var is greater than 1, then it will be polynomial regression.  
e.g. y = a+b*x^2
