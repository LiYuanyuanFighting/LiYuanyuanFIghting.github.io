**Discrete probability distributions**  
**Binomial Distribution**  
The Binomial distribution B(n, p) we can derive as follows, that is the probability that   
the event A occurs exactly x times in n replicates is derived as follows:  
The event A occurs only with the first x experiments: A, A,..., A,(x times), B, B, B, ..., A  
(n-x) times.  
The probability of this sequence of independent experiments is p^x(1-p)^(n-x).  
Considering all possible arrangemenmts (n x)(Note: this should be vertical) the following applies:  
P(hn(A)=x) = (n x)p^x(1-p)^(n-x), where (n x)=n!/( (n-x)!x! ) is the Binomial coefficient.
