**Oracle Error: PLS-00320**
Error Description:
The declaration of the type of this expression is incomplete or malformed

Error Cause:
In a declaration, the name of a variable or cursor is misspelled or the declaration makes a forward reference. Forward references are not allowed in PL/SQL. A variable or cursor must be declared before it is referenced it in other statements, including other declarative statements. For example, the following declaration of dept_rec raises this exception because it refers to a cursor not yet declared: DECLARE dept_rec dept_cur%ROWTYPE; CURSOR dept_cur IS SELECT ... ...

Action:
Check the spelling of all identifiers in the declaration. If necessary, move the declaration so that it makes no forward references.
