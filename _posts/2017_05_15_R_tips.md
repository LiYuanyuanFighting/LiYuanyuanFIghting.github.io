**To install new packages**     
```r
 install.packages("sos") // don't forget to add double quotes
```

**To search for package**  
```r
library(sos) 
findFn('Anderson-Darling') 
```  

Don't forget to load library before using!

**Difference from density and ecdf**  
[density](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/density.html)(x, ...)  
The (S3) generic function density computes kernel density estimates. Its default method does so with the given kernel and bandwidth for univariate observations.  
So I infer that what returned are about density estimates, not a function  
[ecdf](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/ecdf.html)  
Compute an empirical cumulative distribution function, with several methods for plotting, printing and computing with such an “ecdf” object 
So ecdf returns a function, not a value  

```r
> new_func <- ecdf(data1)
> f1 <- function(x0, mean = 20, sd = 40) {
+ new_func(x0) - dnorm(x0, mean, sd)
+ }
> integrate(f1, lower=0, upper=100)
74.17265 with absolute error < 0.00011
> new_func 
Empirical CDF 
Call: ecdf(data1)
 x[1:19] =    -57,    -29,    -12,  ...,     73,    100
```  

```r  
> new_func <- density(data1)
> f1 <- function(x0, mean = 20, sd = 40) {
+ new_func(x0) - dnorm(x0, mean, sd)
+ }
> integrate(f1, lower=0, upper=100)
Error in new_func(x0) : could not find function "new_func"  
> new_func

Call:
        density.default(x = data1)

Data: data1 (19 obs.);  Bandwidth 'bw' = 15.47

       x                 y            
 Min.   :-103.40   Min.   :1.527e-05  
 1st Qu.: -40.95   1st Qu.:8.739e-04  
 Median :  21.50   Median :2.873e-03  
 Mean   :  21.50   Mean   :3.999e-03  
 3rd Qu.:  83.95   3rd Qu.:6.612e-03  
 Max.   : 146.40   Max.   :1.112e-02   
 ```  
 
 So it is not able to create function from density, but be able to do it using ecdf.  
 
 Why not use ecdf directly?  
 --Because in R can not use non-numeric argument to binary operator.  
```r 
 > f <- function(q, mean = 20, sd = 40) {
+ ecdf(data1) - pnorm(q, mean, sd)
+ }
> integrate(f, lower=0, upper=100)
Error in ecdf(data1) - pnorm(q, mean, sd) : 
  non-numeric argument to binary operator  
```   
in this example, ecdf(data1) is a function, but pnorm(q, mean, sd) is a value, so  
"-" can't be used between them. So it should use the format as above.  

Note: for this problem, I asked friend. In fact, I should be able to get it by mysel. First, I should figure it  
out, which one is not numeric, if not numeric, how to do and how to use self defined function correcly, but I   
guessed it was ecdf before... So think more clearly next time!
