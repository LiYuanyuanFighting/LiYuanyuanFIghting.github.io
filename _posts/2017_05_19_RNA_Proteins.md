# RNA and Proteins

**RNA** stands for RiboNucleic Acid, as its name indicates. This molecule is very close to DNA, yet there are a few differences. The differences between DNA and RNA are that RNA is composed of five compound sugar molecules of A, U, G, C nucleotides, instead of A, T, G, C.   RNA is translated into proteins in a cytoplasm organelle called a *ribosome*. *Tanslation* is what occurs there. In other words, DNA yields RNA, which in turn yields two proteins.  

In summary, the process of transforming DNA into RNA is called **transcription** and takes place in a cell nucleus. This RNA, once transported into ribosomes, which are organelles located in a cell's cytoplasm, is translated into a protein. So different sorts of RNA, mRNA, rRNA and tRNA. The mRNA, or messenger RNA, is the one which specializes in coding for proteins. The RNA rRNA, or ribosomal RNA, is located in the ribosomes. That is an integral part of them, 60%. It assists with the translation process as an RNA coming from the nucleus. Finally is the tRNA, or transfer RNA, also assisting the mRNA translation by carrying each new amino acid to the growing end of a protein being created. Each amino acid has its specific tRNA to accomplish this function. The term that's most widely used to talk about RNA is gene expressions. You will see this term constantly when working with genetic datasets. This picture summarizes again the processes and transcription and translation. Genes are expressed by being transcribed into RNA, and this transcript may then be translated into a protein.   

The set of proteins in the body is called **proteome**. Some questions we will answer regarding the proteome are how they are coded from the genes, where are the genes located, and how do the encoding gene function. It is important to know that proteins can be in different states which makes them more or less active, such as phosphorylated, glycosylated, or with added coenzymes.   
  
One is **data quality**. A term often used to illustrate the importance of data quality to data analysis is garbage in garbage out, or GIGO. The reason it will noise into data, storing complex molecule or sequences may be difficult.   

There is quite a bit of redundancy into data are coming from different representations, DNA, RNA, cDNA corresponding complimentary, which can all be found in the data we study. cDNA is obtained by taking a single strand of RNA and using a process reverse from transcription to create the RNA complement in the form of the cDNA. Different methods, single-pass sequence, multi-fold repetition of a sequence. Different fragments, pre-mRNA can lead to several levels of splicing in DNA, called alternative splicing.   
Difficulty to differentiate between two analogous sequences and related ones.For these reasons, it is required to check the data carefully before analyzing it.
